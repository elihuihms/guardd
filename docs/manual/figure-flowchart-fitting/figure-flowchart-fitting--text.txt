* Load data into program
* Perform grid search on desired curve sets (batch task)

--- Optimize fit for each curve set ---
* Select curve set
* Select grid fit (min chi^2 from grid search)
* Exhibits exchange? (see below)
      o Yes exchange
	    + Set this as best fit and update windows
		  # Check Chi2 space and rate analyses
	    + Refine parameters from grid result if needed
		  # Set this new fit as the best fit and update
	    + Can any parameters be accurately extracted?
		  # Some parameters are OK
			* Mark best fit OK
			* Mark which parameters are OK
		  # None of the parameters are OK
			* Mark best fit NOT OK
			* Doesn't matter which parameters are selected as OK
      o No exchange
	    + Set the NoEx fit as the best fit (it is by default)
	    + Select best fit OK
* Make notes on curve set
      o Click save
* Move onto next curve set (first step)
---------------------------------------

* Calculate errors on best fits (batch task)
* Examine motions of entire molecule (group analysis)


Exhibits exchange if:
  Rex > ~2 Hz
    and/or
  χ2Red(Ex) < χ2Red(NoEx)
